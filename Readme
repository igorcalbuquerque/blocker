# Blocker

**Blocker** is a command-line application written in Rust that allows you to block access to specified websites on your computer. By modifying the hosts file, Blocker redirects domains to localhost, effectively preventing access to the listed sites. This tool can help increase productivity by blocking distracting websites or enhance parental controls by restricting access to inappropriate content.
